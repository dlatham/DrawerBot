# DrawerBot

A program for arduino that controls the motion of a robotic drawer enabling storage in places out of reach. This program controls 2-axis motion - linear motion (tested with a lead screw) and lifting / lowering motion using a winding drum (tested using a motor connected via worm gear). Motion start/stop is controlled using 2 limit switched for linear movement and a single (up position) limit switch for the lifting motion. Lowering motion is controlled using adjustable active state time.
